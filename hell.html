                <center><p>Kyle LeBlanc is an American working overseas in Magnitogorsk, Russia. When he hears his wife being attacked over the phone, Kyle rushes home, but is too late to save her. Sergio Kovic, the man who raped and murdered his wife, buys the judge and is found not guilty due to lack of evidence. Enraged by the lack of justice, Kyle steals a gun from a Bailiff and shoots Sergio multiple times in front of the entire court house, killing him. For this, he is sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Once he arrives, he is beaten by a guard for hesitating to give up his wedding ring. The same night, he witnesses fellow American, Billy Cooper, a 21-year-old inmate taken to another cell to be raped by prison fighter, Andrei, a member of the Russian Mafia with the assistance of the guards.

The next morning, a beaten and traumatized Billy, is taken to infirmary by the guards as Andrei leaves the cell. Kyle gets into a brawl with Andrei, who provoked him in a way similar to his wife's murderer, and is put in solitary confinement. In solitary, he goes on hunger strike and attempts to commit suicide, but fails. When he experiences flashbacks of his wife, he realizes he must survive. Eventually, he is transferred to a cell with inmate 451, an African-American prisoner, who has the reputation of killing inmates, and the sadistic Chief of the guards (Carlos GÃ³mez) believes he will do the same to Kyle. However, over time they begin to trust one another.

He soon meets Billy in the prison yard, who explains he is serving a year and a half sentence for driving drunk and crashing into a restaurant with a girl he met. He also meets Malakai, another American prisoner who uses a wheelchair and explains the politics of the prison and the gangs within it, including the Russian Mafia's alliance with the guards.

The corrupt general who runs the prison gambles by betting on fights between rival gangs. Kyle, who is constantly bullied by Andrei and his goons, begins training himself for these fights but his motivation concerns 451. He faces Andrei in his first fight. Despite Andrei being an experienced fighter and gaining the upper hand. Out of energy, a beaten Kyle savagely bites a large chunk off of Andrei's neck, killing him in agony. He immediately suffers a mental breakdown while covered in Andrei's blood as the prisoners and guards watch in horror. Throughout his time, he continuously fights other prisoners and begins to accept his sentence, hardened by his environment and losing himself while also gaining respect. He denies any help from his brother-in-law or the American embassy stating "Nothing will change" and loses hope of ever being released. At one point, 451 asks him, "Do you even know who you are? Probably not." Meanwhile, Billy attempts multiple times to escape the prison, first by running during outside work detail, and again by sneaking off during the Russian Independence Day celebration; the latter fails as he is betrayed by Malakai, who informs the guards because his need of special medicine. 451 discovers his betrayal, and in retaliation, pours lighter fluid on him and sets him on fire. As he watches Malakai burn to death, he recalls memories of him being abused and molested as a child by a teacher and then setting said teacher on fire.

After being locked in a cell with prison fighter Valya overnight to be raped, Billy is beaten to within an inch of his life after he spits in Valya's face. Billy later succumbs to his injuries, but before he dies, he whispers to Kyle, "Don't let them turn you into something you're not." With this advice, Kyle now knows he must fight another battle: the fight for inner peace, as it is the only way he can become the man he once was. He refuses to fight Valya in his next match, and as a result, is hung by his arms outside for all to see. However, seeing Kyle's courage and his ability to stay strong during his long punishment, the prison gangs decide to put aside their rivalries and unite, following suit by refusing to fight when the general commands it. Kyle is released soon from his restraints and sent to the infirmary. During his recovery, he dreams of his wife who tells him "Nobody's ever gone as long as there is someone to remember them".
                    <br>

Sometime after he is recovered, he is taken to his cellblock. The general is frustrated by his authority being challenged. He informs Kyle he only wants one last fight and forces him to face Miloc, a gargantuan prisoner kept separate from the general population who Kyle kept hearing through the walls from his time in solitary confinement. During the fight, Kyle knocks on a door repeatedly, making Miloc recognize him, as this was his only form of communication, and he embraces him as a friend. A guard orders them to continue at gunpoint. Kyle demands the guards kill him instead, stating he will not fight anymore. Witnessing this, the prisoners begin to protest. Kyle and Miloc turn on the guards and free the prisoners from their cells, igniting a full-scale riot. Miloc is fatally shot protecting Kyle, who comforts him as he succumbs to his wounds.

Soon, 451 gives Kyle the evidence of all the murders and corruption that have happened in the prison for over twenty years that he has planned to expose to the US government. While the guards get the prisoners under control following the riot, 451 shows Kyle a secret passage to the prison garage for their next move. It will, though, require Kyle to fight one more time to gain access,. Kyle faces Valya in his final fight. During the fight, Kyle gains the upper hand and dislocated Valya's shoulder. An enraged Valya pulls a knife and attempts to stab him but only to accidentally stab the leader of the Russian Mafia, killing him. Kyle shortly smashes Valya's head into a pole stating "This is for Billy". Kyle is escorted away, knowing the guards will kill him as he is a liability. As Kyle is taken to the garage, 451 launches an attack and kills one of them, while Kyle holds the other at gunpoint and pins him underneath a car. After taking the key to free himself, Kyle takes one of the guards' uniforms to disguise himself and drives off in one of their cars, while 451 stays behind to assassinate the general for his misdeeds. Kyle successfully manages to escape while hanging a picture of his wife on the car mirror saying "We did it. Together!" 451 has successfully killed the general by ripping his tongue out with pliers. His final fate is unknown, but Kyle manages to return to The United States and expose the prison's corruption. Three months later the prison is shut down.</p></center>
